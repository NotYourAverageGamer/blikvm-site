The Raspberry Pi IPKVM HAT is an add-on board for Raspberry Pi 4, made especially for KVM Over IP.  
BLIKVM-RPI4 is a Raspberry Pi 4 PoE KVM HAT.  This productâ€™s key features include video capture, ATX adapter,PoE, OLED and RTC. The product has a customized metal case to dissipate heat and provide protection for the HAT. The product can be easily installed on a standard 1U rack. The product is currently perfectly compatible with blikvm image and pikvm image.

## **Installation requirements**
!!! note "If you have an assembly kit, you will need the following things"
    * Raspberry Pi 4B with 1Gb RAM or more.
    * HDMI cable.
    * Straight Ethernet cable (for the ATX board connection).
    * Power supply unit & cable(5.1V 3A USB-C, recommended by the Raspberry Pi).

## **Basic setup**
**1.** [Flash the memory card or eMMC ](./flashing_os.md) 

**2.Build BLIKVM** according to the video instruction or review the instructions:

??? note "**HDMI IN**"
    The bridge chip is Toshiba TC358743, which supports both video and audio(I2S), and the highest input resolution is 1080p@50fps.
    Fixed HDMI back power issue.

??? note "**CN-ATX**"
    The CN-ATX interface is connected to the ATX adapter board (an accessory for the HAT)through a network cable, which can turn on, 
    off, and restart the controlled computer.

??? note "**Display**"
    A white OLED display with a resolution of 128x32, and the chip is SSD1306. 
    This display can show the temperature, IP address and other information of the Raspberry Pi.

??? note "**PoE**"
    - **Standard:** IEEE 802.3af PoE
    - **Input voltage:** 37-57 V DC
    - **Output power:** 5 V DC/2.4 A
    - Plug in the PoE jumper cap to enable PoE power supply

??? note "**FAN**"
    The IPKVM HAT is fitted with a small fan that is controlled by your Raspberry Pi via GPIO12. 

??? note "**Real Time Clock (RTC)**"
    The clock chip is PCF8563 that is controlled by your Raspberry Pi via I2C. The coin cell battery is installed under the HDMI IN module.

## **Accessories**

### **ATX adapter board**

This board is connected to the switch port on the motherboard of the controlled computer with DuPont cables. 
The board has a standard PCIe I/O bracket and a low profile PCIe  I/O bracket.

### **USB/PWR splitter**

- Connect the RPI4 port to your Raspberry Pi 4.
- Connect the USB port to the controlled computer.
- When using PoE power supply, there is no need to connect the PWR port. When not using PoE power supply, connect the PWR port to a standard 5V/3A USB power supply.

### **HDMI pass-through EDID emulator**
