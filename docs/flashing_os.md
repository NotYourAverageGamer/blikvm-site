    From this video you can learn how to flash image quickly.[How to flash the eMMC on a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp_mF1RknU4)

###  Linux usbboot
If you use an Micro-SD Card, you don't need to care about that.
```
# sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev  
# git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot
# cd usbboot
# make
# sudo ./rpiboot
```
If the content shown in the figure below appears, it indicates that EMMC initialization is successful.
