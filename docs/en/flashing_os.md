### Board Link
First, use the jumper cap to short the boot pin.
!!! info "If you use BLIKVM CM4 version"
    Then connect the data cable to the USB OTG interface. Power on blikvm and observe the act light, the green light is always on.

!!! info "If you use BLIKVM PCIe version"
    Then connect the data cable to the USB-PC interface. Power on blikvm and observe the ACT and PWR LED isn't light. 
    After initialize EMMC through the usbboot/rpiboot, the ACT and PWR LED light is always on.

!!! tip "EMMC knowledge"
    If you use raspberry pi computing modules such as CM3 or CM4 EMMCï¼Œyou can initialize EMMC through the usbboot. Note that the EMMC version cannot directly use the SD card to start the image.
    From this video you can learn how to flash image quickly.[How to flash the eMMC on a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp_mF1RknU4)

**Taking Ubuntu system as an example:**
###  Linux usbboot
If you use an Micro-SD Card, you don't need to care about that.
```
# sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev  
# git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot
# cd usbboot
# make
# sudo ./rpiboot
```
If the content shown in the figure below appears, it indicates that EMMC initialization is successful.

### Using RPi Imager (Linux, MacOS and Windows)

1. Download and install **the latest version** of [RPi Imager](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-imager/releases).

2. Run RPi Imager:
