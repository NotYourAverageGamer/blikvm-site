## **Introduction**
BliKVM-Switch-V1.0 is a four channel HDMI+USB switch, which supports panel button, desktop controller, KVM remote to switch between computers. Maximum support of the switch itself 4K@60HZ Plug and play, drive free.  
BliKVM-Switch-V1.0 uses the same hardware solution as XH-HK4401, AG7210 HDMI switching chip supports up to 4K@60Hz, CH444G USB switching chip supports USB2.0. The difference is that BliKVM-Switch-V1.0 is equipped with KVM USB cable, which can realize KVM port selection. BliKVM-Switch-V1.0 is compatible with BliKVM and PiKVM.
!!! note "points for attention"
    * The switch can be powered directly from the USB input to the computer, that is, the switch can work normally without power supply.
    * If the USB power supply of the controlled computer cannot make the switch work, the switch can be powered independently.
    * The switch package only provides a USB power cable, but does not provide a power adapter. The customer needs to configure a power adapter (5V).
    * **Desktop controller** can control HDMI switch with USB cable. For customers who do not use KVM, this is another way of switching for easy cable management.
    * HDMI input support up to **4096x2160/60Hz** resolution
    * 4K 60Hz input, the power is about 200 mW.

## **Software configuration**
!!! info "If you are using BliKVM software and have powered on the switch and connected the cables before starting BliKVM, no additional configuration is needed. BliKVM will automatically detect the switch when it starts. If automatic detection fails, you can manually specify the switch device. First, confirm the device descriptor name of the switch by using the terminal, such as `/dev/ttyUSB0`. Then, edit the `switch_handle` field in `/usr/bin/blikvm/package.json` and assign `/dev/ttyUSB0` to it. Afterward, restart BliKVM. Click **MORE** in the lower left corner, find the BliKVM switch column, and then switch. Note that the flashing blue dot of the corresponding channel indicates that the switch insertion is recognized and is in the current channel. If there is no blue dot, the switch insertion is not recognizedã€‚"

!!! info "If you use PiKVM software, please configure it according to the following instructions."
    1. Log in to PiKVM through SSH. The user name and password are root;
    2. Uses the `rw` command on the terminal to change the system to a read-write system;
    3. Edit `/etc/kvmd/override. yaml` this file to make it contain the following contents. That is, add after the original content.
        ```

    4. Use the `ro` command on the terminal to reset the system to a read-only system;
    5. Use 'systemctl restart kvmd' on the terminal to restart the service;
    6. Enter the PiKVM web interface and click the GPIO menu. You should see 4 inputs, one of which has a green circle to indicate that it is currently selected. Click Other Inputs to change the selected host.
