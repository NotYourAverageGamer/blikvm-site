# BLIKVM PCIe

## **Introduction**

![main1](assets/images/BLIKVM-PCIe/BLIKVM_PCIe_main1.png){width="500"}

BLIKVM PCIe is a PCIe add-in card based on Raspberry Pi CM4 for KVM Over IP. This productâ€™s key features include video capture, ATX controller, PoE, OLED , UART and RTC. The card has a standard PCIe I/O bracket and a low profile PCIe  I/O bracket. The product is currently perfectly compatible with blikvm image and pikvm image.

## **Installation requirements**
!!! note "You will need the following things"
    * Raspberry Pi CM4(if you order PCIe card only).
    * PoE-sourcing equipment or 5V/3A USB adapter.
    * CR1220 coin cell battery.

## **Basic setup**
**1.** [If you have an assembly kit, Flash the memory card or eMMC ](./flashing_os.md)   
**2.Build BLIKVM** according to the [illustrated instructions](./BLIKVM-PCIe-installation.md):

!!! note "**HDMI IN**"
    The bridge chip is Toshiba TC358743, which supports both video and audio(I2S), and the highest input resolution is 1080p@60fps.
    Fixed HDMI back power issue.

!!! note "**USB-PC**"
    There are two USB-PC ports on the product, and users can choose any USB-PC port.

!!! note "**POWER-IN**"
    When using PoE power supply, there is no need to connect the PWR-IN port. When not using PoE power supply, connect the PWR-IN port to a standard 5V/3A USB power supply.

!!! note "**ETHERNET-PoE**"
    - Gigabit Ethernet port
    - **Standard:** IEEE 802.3af PoE
    - **Input voltage:** 37-57 V DC
    - **Output power:** 5 V DC/2.4 A

!!! note "**ATX-Connecter**"
    Connect to power control interface on the motherboard of the controlled computer with DuPont cables. It can turn on, off, and restart the controlled computer.

!!! note "**OLED Display**"
    A white OLED display with a resolution of 128x64, and the chip is SSD1306. This display can show the temperature, IP address and other information of the Raspberry Pi.

!!! note "**FAN**"
    The Card HAT is fitted with a small fan that is controlled by your Raspberry Pi CM4 via GPIO12. 

!!! note "**BOOT**"
    Fit jumper to disable eMMC Boot

!!! note "**Real Time Clock (RTC)**"
    The clock chip is PCF8563 that is controlled by your Raspberry Pi CM4 via I2C. The CR1220 battery is installed under the HDMI IN module.

!!! note "**UART**"
    Connect the serial port to debug your Raspberry Pi CM4.

## **Accessories**

![BLIKVM_PCIe_main-back](assets/images/BLIKVM-PCIe/accessories.png){width="400"}
!!! note "**HDMI pass-through EDID emulator**"
    If the controlled computer does not output HDMI images correctly, please use this accessory. Connect the Source port to the controlled computer, connect the Sink port to the HAT. Then you can set the correct HDMI output on the controlled computer.

!!! note "**VGA-HDMI module**"
    When your device does not have an HDMI output interface, you can use a VGA to HDMI module.

!!! note "**USB to TTL module**"
    Connect your computer usb interface with the serial port of BLIKVM to debug your Raspberry Pi CM4.

!!! note "**Fan**"
    Use a cooling fan to cool the Raspberry Pi CM4, but installing a fan will make the product thicker than a standard PCIe add-in card.
